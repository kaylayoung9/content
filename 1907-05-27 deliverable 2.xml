              <p>MONDAY, MAY 27, I907.</p>
                <p>ENGLAND AND GERMANY.</p>
                <p>The business of a statesman, said Bismarck a good many years ago is to see things
                    as they are. What is the statesman's business is also the business of every
                    citizen in so far as he concerns himself with his country's affairs or with its
                    relations with other countries. "We all want to see things as they are. Yet it
                    is not always easy, What, for instance, (asks the “Morning Post”), is at present
                    the idea and the feeling of the majority of Germans on the subject of this
                    country and of British policy. If we were to be guided in our judgment by what
                    we read in some of the German newspapers we might imagine that the Germans were
                    all idled with apprehensions of some dire design supposed to be cherished in
                    England against the welfare, the expansion, or even the peace of Germany As no
                    Englishman is aware of any such design, indeed as all of us know that no such
                    design exists, there would be a temptation to suppose the population of Germany
                    is afflicted with some</p>
                <p>mental disease or with one of those extraordinary delusions of which a once much
                    read writer wrote a history. But those who have in late years travelled in
                    Germany and mixed with the people in that country have discovered that among the
                    educated class there,” the representative character of the newspapers is denied,
                    and it is asserted that the articles unfriendly to England are not the
                    expression of the popular feeling, or, at any rate, are not to bo taken too
                    seriously. Between those newspapers which make it their Business to preach down
                    England and those cultivated Germans who denounce these newspapers it is hard to
                    get at the facts and see things as they are. The Germans outside of Germany, the
                    travelled Germans, are not anti-British. They generally know something of
                    England and the English. But they are not always listened to with respect by the
                    Germans at home, at any rate not by all the newspaper writers. It is to be hoped
                    that there will shortly be a change of fashion in Germany, and that the habit of
                    discussing the imagined deep-laid plots of England will die out. Meantime it may
                    help towards the clear view which is so desirable to consider some of the
                    undoubted facts about the German Empire which are apt to he forgotten not only
                    here but there.</p>
                <p>Germany has for a whole generation been enjoying steady and increasing
                    prosperity. None of the great States of Europe has so much to show in the way of
                    material progress. Most of the large towns have been within the last twenty live
                    years so transformed as to seem to have been almost entirely re-built. The
                    standard of comfort, and even of luxury, attained is beyond the dreams of the
                    last generation. Manufacture, trade, and commerce have flourished exceedingly.
                    The whole country bears on its face the marks of accumulating wealth. For
                    education of all sorts and for the advancement and diffusion ot knowledge,
                    provision is made on an ampler scale than in any other country of Europe.</p>
                <p>These great advances have followed close upon and seemed to be the consequences
                    of the great struggles which led to the foundation of the new Empire as the form
                    and symbol of national unity. Accordingly the national self consciousness has
                    been exalted, and Germans today take a legitimate pride in their country. The
                    Army is considered, probably rightly, to be the best organised and the best
                    trained in the world, and the Navy has for a whole generation worked hard to
                    make itself the Army's counterpart Germany’s influence makes itself felt far and
                    wide, not merely in Europe. These are some of the marks of greatness in a
                    nation. The nation that is so well situated in regard to its arrangements for
                    defence, for education, and for trade, and of which the prosperity is so
                    remarkable, can hardly have good reason to be excessively timid or anxious as to
                    the future. Yet there are a number of writers in Germany who seem to spend their
                    time looking abroad for possible troubles, and for several years past they have
                    represented England as the most probable source of danger to Germany. If these
                    writers had all been silent it is quite possible that traders and manufacturers
                    in England and in Germany would have been conscious of a certain rivalry. Mr.
                    Haldane, in a speech the other day, spoke of “ the legitimate antagonism of
                    trade competition. ” But it is by no means clear that this antagonism need have
                    a national or international aspect. Two spinners in Bolton are much keener
                    rivals one of the other than either of them of any German competitor,and yet
                    they can manage to live together in the same town without quarrelling. It would
                    not be easy to find a British trader or manufacturer who would wish this country
                    to pick a quarrel with Germany. Some of them would be glad to be helped against
                    German competition by a protective tariff, but they would not on that account
                    wish the two nations to enter into the extreme competition of a war Moreover,
                    men of business best realise that the best customers are rich industrious
                    nations, and that Germany and England with or without tariffs on one side or on
                    both are necessarily bound to have very large commercial dealings with one
                    another. Apart from manufacture and trade where the two nations are competitors,
                    but not necessarily unfriendly competitors, what are the interests of the two
                    nations which clash if We have never been able to discover them There is no
                    rational cause for a quarrel between England and Germany, and f a quarrel arises
                    it must be due to some wrong, malice, or misunderstanding. These things it is
                    not always possible to prevent. They ought not to arise, and it is the duty of
                    each nation and of each Government to avoid being the author of any such
                    occasion of dispute, and of course also to be strong enough in case of a
                    gratuitous quarrel thrust upon it to defend itself.</p>

                            presidence of the French Vice Consul, M Charles Drenilhes. Invitations
                            were freely distributed, and an excellent attendance of parents and
                            friends of the pupils was the result. The course and grounds were
                            prettily decorated, and the smartness and precision with which the
                            various movements were carried out, to the accompaniment of the St.

                            the Courts of Saxony and Saxe-Cobourg and Gotha, has also been appointed
                            Charge d’Affaires at the Court of Wableck and Pyrmont.</p>
                        <p>Sir William Willeocks, we are pleased to hear is well on the road to
                            recovery from his recent serious illness. He, is on the way to
                            Motahassawhere he leaves on June 7 by a German East Africa boat. He will
                            go through the Canal about the 18th or 19th and go straight to
                            England.</p>

                        <p>An important scheme for the creation of a garden city for Alexandria has
                            been set on foot. Messrs. Prazzica, P. Zouibos, and Bouzas have sold to
                            Baron Felix de Menasce and Messrs. Ahuagia and Camitz thirty thousand
                            and ninety square pics at Abou Nawatir between the Carlton Hotel and the
                            Aboukir line for LE. 19,500. The purchasers also intend buying land in
                            the vicinity and the estate will form a plateau on an average twenty
                            metres above sea level, which will form a healthy site for a garden
                            city.</p>

                       <p>THE MEETING OF THE RANKS.</p>
                        <p>FORMATION OF SYNDICATE</p>
                        <p>The adjourned meeting of the managers of the big local kinks and the
                            heads of the private kinking houses took place at the Alexandria offices
                            of the National Bank yesterday. It was decided by the majority of the
                            kinks to form a syndicate and the capital of the concern will amount to
                            a very respectable figure. Unfortunately all the important banks were
                            not unanimous, as the board of directors of the Credit Lyonnais refused
                            to give their assent to the manager here to join the syndicate on the
                            part of the great French banking establishment. As some of the managers
                            of the other banks had made their adherence to the syndicate conditional
                            on unanimity, the secession of the. Credit Lyonnais has obliged the
                            managers of the Comptoir National d’Escoiupte de Paris, the Imperial
                            Ottoman Bank, and. the Credit Franco Egyptien to inform their boards of
                            directors of the fact of this abstention before obtaining consent to
                            forming part of the syndicate. The majority of the banks, however, have
                            agreed and the syndicate therefore may be regarded as an accomplished
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>The refusal of the board of directors of the Credit Lyonnais to allow
                            that bank to join has created a somewhat unfortunate impression in view
                            of the important position that, bank has always held in Egypt. In view
                            also of the fact that it has occupied an official position here ns the
                            custodian of the monies of the Caisse de la Dette and has gained
                            considerable influence from such a position, it is considered that the
                            board of directors should have shown their confidence in the stability
                            of Egypt’s financial position at the present time by at. once giving the
                            necessary permission to their manager to materially assist in
                            ameliorating the severe crisis, through which the Bourses of Alexandria
                            and Cairo are now passing, by coming into line with the other important
                            banking institutions in the country.</p>
                        <p>Nothing definite has yet been decided as to the procedure which the
                            syndicate will adopt. We understand that there will he no hard and fast
                            rules in regard to limits, etc. It is suggested that the committee of
                            management should meet, say, once a week and decide its to ’the course
                            to pursue in view of the possible fluctuating character of the market
                            from, week to week. However,nothing has as yet definitely been decided
                            on these points. At any rate it is a matter for congratulation that the
                            syndicate is an accomplished fact and the constitution of such a body
                            should be of material assistance in stopping any further increase in the
                            “rot” in the local bourses, which might otherwise have-become highly
                            contagious. Capitalists and small investors will now know that the
                            minimum prices are guaranteed and this should induce buyers to come into
                            the market.</p>

                        <p> LORD CROMER AND THE SOLICITOR </p>
                        <p>From the “Daily Telegraph” of Saturday, the 18th inst. :</p>
                        <p>Circumstantial rumours have been current during the last few days
                            concerning the disappearance of one of the partners of a well-known firm
                            of City solicitors. There seems little doubt that the rumours are well
                            founded, and that the Stock Exchange, if not any private clients of the
                            firm, will suffer substantially. As usual, a good deal of loose talk is
                            heard concerning the sums involved, but there is reason to believe that
                            they have been unduly magnified, and that they will prove to be below
                            £100,000. It was quite, commonly reported that Lord Cromer had been
                            seriously hit in connection with the matter, but we have the best
                            authority for stating that there is no truth whatever in the reports, so
                            far as his lordship is concerned, and that the late British Agent in
                            Egypt has not and could not have lost anything at all, as his securities
                            are in the safe keeping of Messrs, Barings. It may also be as well to
                            state that the firm in question,although they used to act for the
                            family; are not the solicitors of Messrs. Baring Bros.</p>

                       <p> IMPORTANT PROPERTY SALE </p>
                       <p>The College des Freres in Cairo, situated opposite the new Roman Catholic
                            Cathedral now under erection in the Ismailieh quarter, has just been
                            disposed of to Mr. Moise Levi, of the firm of Zoucas and Levi. The
                            property is a little over 2,100 square metres and the price paid is
                            almut £30 the metre. The Freres received in part payment the house and
                            grounds belonging until lately to Moustaplia Pasha Fehiny, the Prime
                            Minister, the latter property having an area of 6,000 square metres and
                            being situated in Sharia Mansour; it passed into the possession recently
                            of Mr. Levi. The house will be considerably enlarged for the
                            accommodation of the large number of pupils, between 300 and 400, now
                            attending the schools and these will be transferred from Ismailieh to
                            the Bab-el-Louk quarter in September. A position of the ground on which
                            stands the present College was purchased 19 years ago at 33 francs the
                            metre, and for the land adjacent, on which an extension was built about
                            4 years back, between £6 and £7 the metre was paid. The next building on
                            which the English Nursing Home was formerly located, consisting of a
                            large house and 1,000 metres, was offered to the Freres in 1905 at £7
                            the metre and was bought by Mr. Moise Levi nt that price ; the latter
                            now asks £20,(KM) for the property, from which figures it is natural to
                            assume that houses and sites in the Ismailieh quarter of the capital are
                            not declining in value as some persons declare.</p>

                        <p>/Cairo, May 13.</p>
                        <p>Before I left Cairo I had the honour of being requested by his Highness
                            the Khedive to have an interview with him previous to my departure. I
                            have been in friendly relations not only with Abbas II., but with his
                            father, Tewfik Pasha; and the uniform courtesy and friendliness which I
                            have experienced at the hands of three generations of the Khedivial
                            family would alone have sufficed to make the invitation welcome to me
                            personally. I felt, also, it would be interesting to the British public
                            to learn the point of view from which his Highness regarded the present
                            situation in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>All those who heard Abbas II. make a speech at the Guildhall banquet
                            given in his honour on his last visit to Loudon are aware that he speaks
                            English until remarkable facility* and accuracy, but I fancy his
                            thoughts run more rapidly in French, and that when he is talking with
                            anyone who can understand French he prefers speaking in that language in
                            preference to English. In common with almost all Orientals after thirty,
                            he is beginning to expand in size, and this fact tends to increase his
                            remarkable - likeness to his grandfather Ismail. Another resemblance
                            between Ismail and his grandson is to be found in the moderation of his
                            comments with regard to everybody, even to persons who might, from his
                            own point of view, have given him cause of offence. In the years of his
                            exile, when Ismail was eating his heart out from his longing to return
                            to Egypt, it was only on very rare occasion as I can vouch, that he
                            spoke with bitterness of those who had contributed to his downfall. In
                            like fashion, Abbas II., as I noticed, though speaking with great
                            apparent frankness, never made a single personal allusion to any cause
                            of offence he might have sustained, or thought he had sustained, during
                            the regime now ended which might not have been repeated at the' British
                            Agency without giving reasonable umbrage of any kind.</p>
                        <p>His Highness expressed his appreciation of the services Lord Cromer had
                            rendered to Egypt by restoring her financial solvency, by encouraging
                            works of irrigation, and thereby promoting the material development of
                            the country. He thought, however, that the material prosperity of Egypt
                            was due quite as much to the exceptional prices of the cotton crop
                            during the last few years as to administrative causes.’</p>
                        <p>As to the military occupation of Egypt, his Highness seemed to me to take
                            a common-sense view. Without expressing any personal opinion, as to
                            whether he would have preferred any other solution of the Egyptian
                            question, he admitted that the logic of facts had brought about the
                            occupation. Egypt was too wealthy and at the same time too weak a
                            country not to fall under the protection of some great European Power so
                            that, in the event of the withdrawal of the British troops, some other
                            Power would necessarily take the place of England, while no other Power
                            could do as much as England had done to promote the material prosperity
                            of his country. He believed that this was in the main the view of his
                            subjects, and that, though they might desire a larger degree of
                            independence at home, they were convinced that, if they were to remain
                            under a protectorate, they saw no advantage, but the contrary, in any
                            change of the Power by whom the protectorate had to be exercised.</p>
                        <p>If I interpreted rightly his somewhat guarded expressions, I should judge
                            that his Highness does not regard any serious change in the existing
                            relations between the protecting and the protected Power as a probable
                            contingency. England, as he intimated, had had several occasions under
                            her military occupation during which she might have converted her
                            temporary occupation into an avowed Protectorate with the consent of
                            other European Powers. He admitted that England had acted in good faith
                            when on each of these occasions she repeated her declarations that she
                            had no intention of remaining permanently in Egypt; but he could not
                            fail to see that each of these refusals on her part to avail herself of
                            the opportunities afforded her had rendered it more and more difficult
                            for her to upset the existing system—under which Egypt was administered
                            by the Khedivial Government, acting under the tutelage of English
                            advisers, without incurring the opposition of Continental Powers. Nor
                            could he perceive what advantage England, even if she were so minded,
                            could hope to obtain by modifying a system under which she is
                            practically supreme in Egypt, without incurring any direct
                            responsibility. His Highness gave me also to understand that lie had
                            never given, any excuse for saying that he had intrigued or conspired
                            against the British occupation, or against the authority of England in
                            Egypt.</p>
                        <p>In connection with this assertion he remarked that ever since his
                            accession to the Viceregal throne he had always received the utmost
                            kindness and courtesy from the Sultan of Turkey, and that he entertained
                            for Abdul Hamid the respect due to him, as the spiritual head of Islam,
                            a faith to which he himself was deeply attached. He declared that he had
                            never given countenance to any ideas that may have been entertained at
                            Constantinople for reasserting Turkish supremacy in the Sinai Peninsula.
                            Whatever his position as Khedive might be, he had one claim which nobody
                            could contest, and that was his being the lineal descendant of Mahomet
                            Ali, the founder of the reigning dynasty. It was,</p>
                        <p>therefore, impossible to imagine that he, of all men in the world, would
                            dream of undoing the work of his illustrious ancestor, and thereby
                            replacing Egypt under Turkish rule.</p>
                        <p>His Highness expressed in the strongest terms his sense of the courtesy
                            he hail uniformly received at the hands of his Majesty King Edward VII.,
                            whom he had always -regarded with sentiments of'* respect and affection.
                            If he were in a position to do so, he should never fail to pay a visit
                            every summer to England, not only as a token of personal friendship, but
                            as a proof of the value he attached to the close connection between
                            Egypt and England under the virtual though unavowed Protectorate
                            exercised by the latter over the former.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the recent crisis Abbas II. said little or nothing' There
                            was not a word uttered by him in disparagement of Lord Cromer or his
                            policy. He paid a very graceful complimentary reference to his
                            lordship’s integrity and ability, alluded to the regret felt at the
                            illness which had terminated so suddenly, and so unexpectedly, his long
                            career as His representative of Great Britain. He also expressed his
                            personal satisfaction at his lordship having recommended Sir Eldon Gorst
                            as his successor, and remarked that when the new Consul-General was
                            financial adviser to the viceregal Government, his -relations with the
                            Khedive hud always been of a very friendly and pleasant kind.</p>
                        <p>He then proceeded to explain to wme, without entering on particulars, the
                            general principle upon which, in his judgment, the relations between the
                            de facto and the de jure Governments of Egypt should be based by rights.
                            That principle was one of cordial co-operation. He felt assured that the
                            British Consul-General, whoever he might be, would have at heart equally
                            with himself the welfare of Egypt In his country, as in every other
                            Eastern land, the people could only appreciate a personal sovereign. As
                            the Khedive himself he represented the element of personal sovereignty,
                            in a way no foreign Consul-General could ever do ; and he believed the
                            wheels of the administrative machine would move far more smoothly if the
                            native and the foreign administrations worked in harmony together, not
                            separately and singly. All I can say is that his Highness assured me
                            that, if his advice were asked upon matters connected with native
                            usages, laws, interests, and even principles, this advice would be based
                            on the paramount necessity of maintaining the principles of justice
                            which have been established under British rule. To do justice without
                            fear or favour was, to his thinking the first and chief duty of every
                            ruler. His complaint against the attacks made upon huff of late by
                            certain English papers was. that they brought specific charges against
                            him, and that when he contradicted these charges in the most positive
                            and solemn manner, no attempt was made to substantiate the charges by .
                            any evidence, and no apology Was offered. This, he said, was not
                            justice, and he thought British good sense would recognise that this was
                            not in accordance with (airplay or justice.</p>

                       <p>EGYPT IN PARLIAMENT.</p>
                        <p>Mr. John Robertson’s question regarding the observation of the Moslem day
                            of rest appears to be rather wide of the mark, perhaps not so much in
                            respect to the Postal Administration but in connection with the
                            observation of days of rest in the Egyptian Government service.</p>
                        <p>There are upwards of forty different holidays in the official calendar,
                            either European or Native and each one of these is strictly observed. If
                            to this is added the Friday observance, the result is at least 90 days
                            out of 365, without taking into consideration the fact that in most of
                            the Ministries the staff work only in the mornings. It might be further
                            remarked that on the Sabbath day as known to Christians very many of the
                            Ministerial staff arc conspicuous by their absence, in some cases
                            following the example of their European chiefs.</p>
                        <p>It must not be supposed for a moment that there is the slightest
                            intention of making any comparison or other invidious distinction
                            between Moslem and Christian days of rest. To readers well acquainted
                            with the country and its habits it should be perfectly evident that the
                            member for the Tyneside division of Newcastle has demonstrated in a most
                            conspicuous manner his extremely, superficial knowledge of the country
                            in which he shows such a fatherly interest, based on a visit of a very
                            short duration.</p>

                       <p> CAIRO MATRIMONIAL ROMANCE </p>
                       <p>A SWINDLING DON JUAN...</p>
                        <p>A certain Aboudra, having ingratiated himself with an elderly native lady
                            of excellent connections, played upon her feelings to such an extent as
                            to obtain a very complete hold on her affections and, incidentally, her
                            finances, or at least a large part of them. </p>
                        <p>The lady in question, Waghida Hanem, is very well off and our Don Juan
                            induced her to believe that her relatives sought to end her days by
                            poison in order to enter into their heritage more speedily. To add to
                            the humbug he surrounded his victim with a battery of charms guaranteed
                            to secure immunity from all dangers and finally induced her to leave her
                            home and seek obscurity in the provinces-</p>
                        <p>Some three months, ago, therefore, the deluded lady left for Zagazig
                            taking with her jewels and money to the value of some £20,000. At
                            Zagazig the happy pair were united, whereupon the relatives of the
                            bride, justly under the impression that the bridegroom was more in love
                            with the fortune of his wife than her person, demanded the revocation of
                            the marriage by the Sharieh Mekhemeh and insisted that the lady be
                            placed under restraint These demands being accorded, and a family
                            committee having been appointed under the presidence of the Governor of
                            Cairo tor the consideration of the questions at issue, the now divorcee
                            was consigned to the care of her brother but</p>
                        <p>refused to rejoin her family, taking refuge with her lawyer; from thence
                            she has disappeared, and no trace of her whereabouts being forthcoming,
                            the family have given information to the police.</p>
                        <p>In spite of a most careful search and the wide publicity given to the
                            matter by the pative press the misguided lady has completely disappeared
                            and sufficiently serious allegations are being made in this connection.
                            It has transpired that this is not Aboudra’s first exploit of this
                            nature and subsequent developments should prove interesting.</p>
